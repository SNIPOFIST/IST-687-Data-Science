Observations 

1. The parquet file is over written and fetches the recently updates data 
2. The data set doesn't load the data uin large size but incrementally it loads and stores in the parquet
when increasing the building house ID the data loads and fetches all the loaded data acurately 
3.The range has to be properly defined to source the data 
4.A new column named building ID is supposed to be created and entered in the data set


To find 
1. how the cost is calculated, do we have a variable for cost or are we performing a feature extraction ? -> we are extracting the electricity in KW units and calculating the rates




Conclusions

1. Find the maximum limit that the range fetches the accurate data and split the range so that the read and load for 5000 houses can be performed sparesly and then combines into a single data set
2.
